## Objective 

You may have some experience of travelling to and from the airport. 

- Have you ever used Uber or any other cab service for this travel? 
- Did you at any time face the problem of cancellation by the driver or non-availability of cars?

Well, if these are the problems faced by customers, these very issues also impact the business of Uber. 

- If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its revenue. 

### Business Objective: 

The aim of analysis is to 

- identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation. 
- As a result of our analysis, we present the root cause(s) and possible hypotheses of the problem(s) and recommend ways to improve them.

###### Note: The data provided as CSV should be put in the same directory as the Notebook for automated execution of the analysis.
