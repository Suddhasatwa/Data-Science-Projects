# Titanic Data Analysis Project. 

(... As taken from the Kaggle website itself ... )

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

## Kaggle Challenge

In this challenge, we need to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). 

This is the legendary Titanic ML competition – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. 

## Personal Objective

The objective in this case is simply to perform as much as possible the analysis of data, to find hidden facts from the available data, to perform feature engineering, and finally to build a series of predictive models to find the best applicable one.
