# Case Study - Voice Classification 

#### Domain 

Media

#### Focus 

optimize selection process

#### Business challenge/requirement

Motion Studios is the largest Radio production house in Europe.  Their total revenue $ 1B+. Company has launched a new reality show â€“ "The Star RJ".  The show is about finding a new Radio Jockey who will be the star presenter on upcoming shows. In first round participants have to upload their voice clip online and the clip will be evaluated by experts for selection into the next round. There is a separate team in the first round for evaluation of male and female voice. 

Response to the show is unprecedented and company is flooded with voice clips. You as a ML expert  have to classify the voice as either male/female so that first level of filtration is quicker.

#### Key issues

Voice sample are across accents

#### Considerations

The output from the pre-processed WAV files were saved into the CSV file

#### Data volume

Approx 3000  records 

#### File 

voice-classification.csv 

#### Fields in Data

meanfreq: mean frequency (in kHz)

sd: standard deviation of frequency

median: median frequency (in kHz)

Q25: first quantile (in kHz)

Q75: third quantile (in kHz)

IQR: interquantile range (in kHz)

skew: skewness (see note in specprop description)

kurt: kurtosis (see note in specprop description)

sp.ent: spectral entropy

sfm: spectral flatness

mode: mode frequency

centroid: frequency centroid (see specprop)

peakf: peak frequency (frequency with highest energy)

meanfun: average of fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal

minfun: minimum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal

maxfun: maximum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal

meandom: average of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal

mindom: minimum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal

maxdom: maximum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal

dfrange: range of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal

modindx: modulation index. Calculated as the accumulated absolute difference between adjacent measurements of fundamental frequencies divided by the frequency range

label: male or female

#### Additional information

NA

#### Business benefits

Since "The Star RJ" is a reality show, time to select candidates is very short.  The whole success of the show and hence the profits depends upon quick and smooth execution.
